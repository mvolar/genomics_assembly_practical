Requirements

Since most of you job as a Bioinfomratican will be downloading finding and checking other peoples repositories and using their readily available code from github. So in order to save tame on the practical your job will be to get everything needed up and running.

Depending on your OS, as you already know you have 3 variants:

- Windows
- MacOS
- GNU/Linux (Ubuntu,kubuntu,linux mint etc.)

MacOS I have no idea how to anything yet, but it is almost as easy as Linux.

On Windows you have to install Windows Subsystem Linux 2 because it is basically the same as running Linux, but without the need for dual boot. Note your windows MUST be up to date (Windows 10 version 2004 and higher (Build 19041 and higher)). The guide for installation (it is fairly trivial, and one of the best ways to do bioinformatics things in 2022), and I advise for now installing 18.04 Ubuntu LTS (you can also google that for know it's very easy) :

On Linux everything should be running natively without any need for intervention
